{"name":"Tweetnest","tagline":"A browsable, searchable and easily customizable  archive and backup for your tweets","body":"This is a fork from Andy Graulund's Tweet Nest. Now, updated with the ability to import your Twitter Archive.\r\n\r\n## Twitter archive import\r\n\r\n* Place your downloaded json archive files (data/js/tweets/[year]\\_[month].js) directly in the archive folder (archive/[year]\\_[month].js)\r\n\r\n* Check if the following files are writeable:\r\n\t- inc/config.php\r\n\t- maintenance/loadarchivelog.txt\r\n\r\n* On new Tweet Nest setups:\r\n\t- follow the tweet nest instructions from http://pongsocket.com/tweetnest/#installation \r\n\t- right after the maintenance/loaduser.php step, run maintenance/loadarchive.php\r\n\t\r\n* On existing instances:\r\n\t- be sure not to overwrite your inc/config.php or you will have to setup your instance again\r\n\t- run upgrade.php\r\n\t- run maintenance/loadarchive.php\r\n\r\nThe importer keeps track of its progress in maintenance/loadarchivelog.txt if it's writable. Should the script die for some reason (php time limit e.g.), just run it again.\r\n\r\nIf you have a large archive (10k+ tweets), I would recommend to do the one-time import via cli (php -f maintenance/loadarchive.php)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHI! THIS IS TWEET NEST.\r\n\r\nTweet Nest is a browsable, searchable and easily customizable archive and backup for your tweets, made in PHP. It runs on a web server. It requires the following:\r\n\r\n* PHP 5.2 or higher with cURL enabled (or 5.1 with the PECL JSON module installed in addition)\r\n* MySQL 4.1 or higher\r\n\r\nTo figure out how to install it, please point your browser to:\r\n\r\nhttp://pongsocket.com/tweetnest/\r\n\r\nAnd go to the \"Installation\" section.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nAndy Graulund\r\npongsocket.com","google":"UA-26880301-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
